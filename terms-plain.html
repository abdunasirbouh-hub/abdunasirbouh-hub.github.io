    <h2>6. Transactions and Payment Terms</h2>
    
    <p><strong>6.1 Platform Role:</strong> AgrilinkEthiopia acts as a facilitator connecting Farmers and Buyers. We do not take ownership of products, guarantee transactions, or assume responsibility for the quality, safety, or legality of products listed on the Platform.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2 Direct Agreements:</strong> Each transaction represents a direct contractual agreement between the Farmer and Buyer. Both parties are bound by the terms of that agreement, including price, quantity, quality, and delivery terms.</p>

    <p><strong>6.4 Payment Methods:</strong> We support various payment methods including bank transfers, mobile money transfers (M-Birr, HelloCash, CBE Birr), and cash on delivery for verified transactions. Additional payment methods may be added at our discretion.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.5 Platform Fees:</strong> AgrilinkEthiopia may charge service fees, transaction fees, or listing fees for certain services. All applicable fees will be clearly disclosed before transaction completion. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>7. Delivery and Shipping</h2>

    <p><strong>7.6 Delivery Documentation:</strong> Both parties should maintain records of delivery, including delivery receipts, condition reports, and any communications regarding the delivery.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Returns, Refunds, and Cancellations</h2>
    
    <p><strong>8.1 Return Policy:</strong> Due to the perishable nature of agricultural products, returns are generally not accepted unless the product is defective, damaged, or significantly different from the description.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.2 Cancellation by Buyer:</strong> Orders may be cancelled before acceptance by the Farmer without penalty. Once accepted, cancellations are subject to Farmer approval and may incur cancellation fees.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.3 Cancellation by Farmer:</strong> Farmers may cancel orders in cases of inventory shortage, force majeure, or other legitimate circumstances. Repeated cancellations may result in account restrictions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.4 Refund Processing:</strong> Approved refunds will be processed within 7-14 business days using the original payment method. Processing times may vary depending on the payment provider.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.5 Partial Refunds:</strong> In cases where only part of an order is defective or unavailable, partial refunds may be issued for the affected portion.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p><strong>9.5 Final Decision:</strong> AgrilinkEthiopia's decision regarding disputes is final and binding, except as may be required by law. Users agree to accept our determinations in good faith.</p>
    
    <p><strong>9.6 Legal Remedies:</strong> Nothing in these Terms prevents users from pursuing legal remedies through Ethiopian courts if disputes cannot be resolved through our internal processes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>9.7 Arbitration:</strong> For disputes exceeding a certain monetary threshold, parties may agree to binding arbitration under Ethiopian arbitration laws as an alternative to court proceedings.</p>
